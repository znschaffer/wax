## Dependancies

We make use of [TagLib](https://taglib.org/) for audio metadata and [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) for our UI.
If you're on OSX:

```bash
brew install taglib ncurses
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig"
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

Wax is configured through a plaintext file `config` located inside `$HOME/.config/wax/`.
This will get autogenerated for you with these defaults:

```
# Path to your music
music_dir = $HOME/Music

# Background ANSI color
bg = 7

# Foreground ANSI color
fg = 0

# Highlight ANSI color
hl = 4
```

You can also pass in your music directory via the command line flag -d.

```bash
wax -d <dir>
```
